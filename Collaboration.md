## Compentencies and Constraints

### Competencies
  - Most of us have some experience with how Github works
  - We have well rounded coding experience (some frontend, some backend)
  - We are all prompt and efficient with meetings, brainstorming, etc.
  
### Constraints
  - Due to our schedules, we may not always be available during weekly meetings
  - For the same reason, it is usually not feasible to meet in-person or virtually during the week; most collaboration is asynchronous

## Future Meetings
  ### Location
   - Our meetings will be primarily held on Zoom.
  
  ### Time
   - Our expected meeting time will be weekly, every Saturday, from 3PM to 4PM.
  
## Roles
  - Team Coordinator - Isaiah Freeman
  - Note Taker - 
  
  
## Collaboration Plans
  ### Roles as Collaborators
   - As collaborators, we plan on working on future aspects of the project asynchronously.
   - Rather than meet while collaborating, we will work on aspects of the project on our own time.
  
  ### Decision Making Processes
   - As we make changes to our repository, we will inform our other teammates if the edit will effect any other code.
   - If a member of our team feels that a different approach for API implementation would be more beneficial, they will contact our other teammates and we can dicuss this either in a meeting or through group chat messaging.
  
  ### Collaboration Protocal within Github
  
   - Team members assigned a specific category to code/develop
    
   - Commits will be arranged to "Squash and merge"
    
   - Commits related to Frontend requires Frontend experts to approve; same for Backend
